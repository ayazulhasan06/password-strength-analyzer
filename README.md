## 🔐 Project Title
Password Strength Analyzer

---

## 📌 Project Description
The Password Strength Analyzer is a cybersecurity-focused application designed to evaluate and improve password security. It analyzes user passwords using entropy calculations and password strength metrics to determine resistance against brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and common password vulnerabilities.

The application also educates users by providing real-time feedback and actionable suggestions to create stronger passwords.

## 🎯 Cybersecurity Objectives
- Prevent weak authentication credentials  
- Reduce the risk of unauthorized access  
- Improve user awareness of password security  
- Align with security best practices and standards  

---

## 🚨 Security Risks Addressed
- Weak and guessable passwords  
- Brute-force and cracking attacks  
- Identity theft  
- Account hijacking  
- Data breaches  

---

## ⚙️ Security Methodology Used

### Password Strength Meter
- Evaluates password length  
- Checks use of uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Identifies numbers and special characters  
- Detects common password patterns  

### Entropy-Based Analysis
- Measures password randomness and unpredictability  
- Assigns a score from 0 to 100  
- Higher entropy indicates stronger password security  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Password strength evaluation algorithms  
- Entropy calculation logic  
- Authentication security concepts  
- Security testing with real-world password scenarios  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User enters a password  
2. The system evaluates strength and entropy  
3. An instant security score is displayed  
4. Suggestions are provided to improve password strength  

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
- Tested with weak, moderate, and strong passwords  
- Verified accuracy across different character sets  
- Ensured meaningful and consistent feedback  

---

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of password security principles  
- Practical knowledge of authentication vulnerabilities  
- Experience in entropy-based security analysis  
- Security-focused application development
